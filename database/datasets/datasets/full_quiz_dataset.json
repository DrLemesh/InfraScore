    "correct_answer": "**Answer:**\n\nFile permissions in Linux are changed using the `chmod` command in two formats: symbolic or numeric mode. Symbolic mode uses the format `chmod [who][operation][permissions]` where 'who' is u (user/owner), g (group), o (others), or a (all); 'operation' is + (add), - (remove), or = (set exactly); and 'permissions' are r (read), w (write), or x (execute). For example, `chmod u+x script.sh` adds execute permission for the owner. Numeric mode uses octal values where read=4, write=2, exec",

The main namespace types include: PID (process isolation), NET (network interfaces), MNT (filesystem mount points), UTS (hostname), IPC (inter-process communication), USER (user and group IDs), and CGROUP (control groups).

For full disk encryption, use LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) with the `cryptsetup` utility. During installation, most distributions offer encryption options, or you can encrypt post-installation with commands like `cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1` to create an encrypted container and `cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 cryptname` to open it.

    "correct_answer": "**Answer:**\n\nGit reflog (reference log) is a mechanism that records when the tips of branches and other references were updated in your local repository. Unlike the commit history shown by `git log`, reflog records all updates to the repository, including commits, resets, merges, rebases, and checkout operations. This makes it invaluable for recovering lost commits after operations like `git reset --hard`, finding commit hashes that are no longer referenced by any branch, or understanding how yo",
